# Churn-Prediction
This project builds an end-to-end customer churn prediction pipeline on the Telco Customer Churn dataset using PyCaret for low-code AutoML and a GPU-accelerated LightGBM classifier. The workflow covers data cleaning, automated preprocessing, model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and performance evaluation with metrics such as ROC‑AUC, confusion matrix, and feature importance.

The final LightGBM model achieves strong discriminative performance (AUC ≈ 0.85) and identifies key churn drivers such as customer tenure, paperless billing, payment method, and contract-related attributes. The notebook is structured so you can quickly retrain the model, run GPU-powered experiments, and adapt the pipeline to your own customer data for production churn scoring and retention strategy design.
